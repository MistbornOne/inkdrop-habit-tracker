# 📈 Habit Tracker for Inkdrop

As a long time user of Notion, I fell in love with the idea of using my notes app to also keep track of my tasks and daily habits. After making the switch to Inkdrop for my main notetaking application, I wanted to have the same capability - so I made this plugin!

I hope this is useful to the community and it's my great pleasure to continue learning through contributing to an amazing tool.
